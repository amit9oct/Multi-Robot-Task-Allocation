Provides the fast DTW (dynamic time-warping) approximation by Stan Salvador and Philip Chan.

The implementation included here is the one that is discussed in: 
<pre>
Toward accurate dynamic time wrapping in linear time and space.. S. Salvador and P. Chan. Intelligent Data Analysis, 11(5):561-580, 2007.
</pre>
and earlier in:
<pre>
FastDTW: Toward Accurate Dynamic Time Warping in Linear Time and Space. S. Salvador & P. Chan. KDD Workshop on Mining Temporal and Sequential Data, pp. 70-80, 2004.
