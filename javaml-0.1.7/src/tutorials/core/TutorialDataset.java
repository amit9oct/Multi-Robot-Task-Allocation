/**
 * This tutorial show how to create a {@link net.sf.javaml.core.Dataset} from a
 * collection of instances. This tutorial assumes you know how to create an
 * {@link net.sf.javaml.core.Instance}. To create instances for this tutorial
 * we will use a method from {@link net.sf.javaml.tools.InstanceTools} to create
 * random instances.
 * 
 * In this tutorial we will create a number of instances and group them in a
 * data set.
 * 
 * Basically a data set is a collection of instances.
