/**
 * A robot that implements BorderSentry is a robot type used for keeping other robots away from the borders,
 * i.e. guarding the borders in order to prevent "wall crawlers".<br>
 * Robots that implement BorderSentry have 400 extra life/energy (500 in total), but is placed at the border
 * of the battlefield when the game is started.<br>
 * Border sentry robots cannot move away from the border area, and they can only make damage to robots that
 * are moving into the border area. The size of the border area is determined by the
 * {@link BattleRules#getSentryBorderSize() battle rules}.<br>
 * This type of robot is intended for use in battles where robots should be forced away from the borders
 * in order to prevent "wall crawlers".<br>
 * Border sentry robots does not get scores, and will not occur in the battle results or rankings.
