/**
 * Implementation of the K-medoids algorithm. K-medoids is a clustering
 * algorithm that is very much like k-means. The main difference between the two
 * algorithms is the cluster center they use. K-means uses the average of all
 * instances in a cluster, while k-medoids uses the instance that is the closest
 * to the mean, i.e. the most 'central' point of the cluster.
 * 
 * Using an actual point of the data set to cluster makes the k-medoids
 * algorithm more robust to outliers than the k-means algorithm.
