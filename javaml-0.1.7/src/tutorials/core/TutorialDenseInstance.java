 * This tutorial shows the very first step in using Java-ML. It will show you

 * in a {@link net.sf.javaml.core.Dataset} and in the machine learning
 * algorithms.
 * 
 * In this class we only work with the {@link net.sf.javaml.core.DenseInstance}.
 * This type of instance has a value for each attribute and has an optional
 * class label.
